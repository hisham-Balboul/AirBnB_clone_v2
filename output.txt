Just as a heads up, the bathroom does not close completely and the shower head is low.  For me it was fine, but difficult for my taller friend to shower comfortably.  </P></LI>

                <LI><P>This place is all about location. It’s minutes from the beach and a short walk to Waikiki or Ft DeRussy beach, or easy bus ride to further sights (e.g., Iolani Palace, Diamonds Head).  As a bachelor suite, the room itself was the perfect size for a couple looking to explore Honolulu. Inside, the décor is pretty and modern and makes a nice private place to relax after a long day of adventure.  Though we didn't get a chance to use the pool (we were too busy exploring Honolulu), it looked well maintained and like a great place to relax.  Outside, the building itself, which is both a hotel and condo buildling, is a bit dated. However, the staff are very friendly, and someone is always around – night or day - to help you in case your key card doesn’t work.  Dana was also a great host, and communication with her was quick and easy!   </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Home is clean, good facilities, comfortable bed and hosts are friendly. It is treated like a hostel, so the hosts are not around aside from check-in or to clean. Strange having a full service kitchen but being unable to use it, although this is mentioned in the listing. The location, although most likely safe, is very residential and not confidence inspiring for tourists, especially those reliant on public transport. Paper is also requested to not be flushed down the toilet and to be placed in a bin instead in the shared bathroom, which is both strange and uncomfortable.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Our stay at the Opera House was a great experience from the moment we booked. Frank and Naomi gave us detailed directions and advice on how to navigate the very tight streets leading up to the house (they don't show up on GPS). Frank was there to greet us and guide us into the parking area (where the car sat untouched for the remainder of the stay), and show us around the house. Naomi called a bit later to make sure all was well. Once settled in we found the house to be very clean, cozy and inviting. While this is a 100+ year old house, it appears to have been renovated recently. Plenty of room in the dresser and closet to unpack. The office sized water cooler was a thoughtful amenity in a dry climate. We loved getting up in the morning, making a pot of coffee (great local roast provided), and enjoying a cup or two on the front porch, in the sun, overlooking the town and the view beyond. The downtown is a short walk from the house, either directly down the stairs, or down the road. As </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Bisbee and the night at Naomi and Frank's was the serendipitous high-light of our Arizona trip.  We were driving for home in NM and stopped in Tombstone (interesting, kitchsy, don't need to do it again) and on the advice of our tour guide decided to swing into Bisbee.  <BR /><BR />Boy, are we glad we did.  We will come back.  <BR /><BR />Some Airbnb research yielded Naomi and Franks place.  Had everything we were looking for and some we didn't know about.  <BR /><BR />Space for three, wi-fi, a beautiful Bisbee view.  <BR /><BR />What we didn't know was how great it was that it had convenient off street parking. <BR /><BR />Naomi called just minutes after our booking went through and gave us check-in information.  <BR /><BR />Frank met us at the turn in to the house and escorted us to their lovely space.  <BR /><BR />The place was just perfect.  Well furnished, spotlessly clean. Beds comfortable (with extra pillows that we appreciate).</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I would have given this room a 5-star review but another guest watching a movie at a loud volume from 2:30-4:00 in the morning was extremely disappointing. My wife and I had to wake up at 4:30 for an early morning event. Both of us had trouble sleeping because of the loud movie. I, in fact, never got back to sleep. Everything David, the host, did and provided was fine. The room was clean and warm. David was very polite, welcoming, and accommodating. The other guest's thoughtlessness, in contrast, was infuriating.</P></LI>

I had a need for ironing my shirts and she went out of her way to purchase an ironing board for my needs on her own. The Location couldn't be any better from a geography standpoint and like le the quaint Location near a public park and restaurants. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Hosts were very responsive and helpful. The house was conveniently located, large, clean and very comfortable. Having 3.5 bathrooms is a big plus. The 5+ bedrooms were very comfortable with nice bedding. Bathrooms were also very nice. Internet was easy to access. Lots of amenities -- hair dryers, shampoo, lotion, etc. Television channels are  limited, so plan on using Netflix/other. </P></LI>

The location is safe. We rented the house for 3 nights for a reunion and it was so much fun. Everyone loved the house. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to rent a house in the suburb. </P></LI>

I was greeted by their pups and barking, but don't be afraid they're actually really sweet. <BR />Although the idea of having your room accessed by others may be a turn off it wasn't that awkward hahaha<BR />In your bedroom they provide a curtain with the bed for extra privacy. It really does make your stay more comfortable and is a very nice detail that helped me sleep more comfortably at night. s a very urban and photogenic area. THANK YOU KATIE AND MATTHIJS ! </P></LI>

There are a few other rooms in the same hallway, with other guest(s) sharing the bathroom. I decided at the last minute to attend a conference in Silicon Valley, so this was a good value alternative to hotels that were running peak pricing at the time.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We had the most wonderful stay at the Beachwalk Bungalow.  We arrived very late at night (much later than we'd said we be there thanks to a travel mishap).  Despite this, the owner, Michelle, waited up for us so that she could welcome us as we arrived and insisted that we text her if we needed anything. Throughout the week, she asked about our trip and told us about great places to see and things to do in the area (including the best local farmers' market EVER).  One night, when we were laughing like hyenas, Michelle thought we'd seen a roach and came running out to SAVE US!  We never did figure out who "Barbara" is, but we really hope Michelle isn't paying her to find guests for her place.  Barbara comes across as very curt (we never met her, though, so we can't say for sure if this is truly her personality; we all know it's tough to gauge a person's tone online).  So, if you're considering staying here but are put off a bit by Barbara</P></LI>

It was perfect for our week long stay. Michelle, our onsite host was lovely and very helpful.  I would highly recommend it and would return again without hesitation.  </P></LI>

My husband and I were visiting from a city life and we both felt like we slept like babies! Perfect breezes, crickets and birds- but quiet residential neighborhood. Michele was super accommodating! Thank you for a great week!! Mahalo!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Beachwalk Bungalow was an ideal place for our trip to Oahu. Michelle and John were excellent hosts. The location was a quick walk to the beach, as well as other restaurants and shops. The Bungalow had all the amenities you would need (coffee maker, towels, beach chairs and even a baby crib). Kailua is definitely a great laid back town!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I stayed for 9 weeks as a clinical student at Edward Hospital, and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Great drive to work, home was lovely, and Kathi is an amazing host. She welcomed me like family (even took care of me when I got the flu), which made the academic stresses far more manageable since I wasn't worried about my living situation on top of it. Also her home is really close to downtown Naperville (5 minute lyft/uber) but in a quiet community, which is like the best of both worlds. I can't give her enough stars! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Kathleen's home is in a nice suburban area of Naperville, only about a mile from the downtown area. Kathleen herself is a fantastic hostess and was very easygoing about our stay. We had an odd check-out time (which was one of our main concerns), but she was able to accommodate our exit extremely well. Many Airbnb hosts simply rent out a room, but Kathleen goes above and beyond to make sure the stay was special. She had tidied a bed for us, laid out some snacks, and showed us where everything in her house was for easy access. She made sure we were comfortable, which is something I appreciate in a host. She was also very easy to get along with.<BR /><BR />Her house itself was very nicely designed and I thoroughly enjoyed being in that space. It was easy to settle into and she made sure everything is great for her guests. If you're looking for a place in the area, I'm sure Kathleen would be the best option. You won't regret it.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Kathleens place is beautiful and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone seeking an Airbnb in Naperville. She was friendly, warm, and very accommodating!<BR /><BR />Checking in was incredibly easy with a key-code on the front door for access. The neighbourhood was great and only 10min walk to the beautiful 'river walk'.<BR /><BR />If I am in Naperville again, I will most definitely book here again.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Kathy is a wonderful host. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and she was good at communicating prior to our stay. The pictures provide an accurate view of this lovely home. Also, we enjoyed walking the trail by the river and the River Walk to Downtown Naperville. The house is in a quiet neighborhood and we were able to walk to a great breakfast place (less than one mile), "The Lucky Penny Diner and Deli". </P></LI>

                <LI><P>I truly enjoyed the stay, it was definitely as stated. Spacious room that was stayed in. The living place does look like it is within the picture. Fabian was a great host, very warming and friendly which was a great feeling. You might slightly get confused in going to the back to check in, but otherwise fine. The only concern that I had while my stay would be if you plan on going out or working late driving a car is not recommended, drove for an hour in attempt to find parking was quite irritating . Otherwise I loved the stay and would gladly comeback again.<BR />I would give my entire day stay a good 4.5-4.8 minus the parking issue coming back late. <BR /><BR />Muchas Gracias Fabian! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>A great location for what I was doing in the city.  The place looks just like the pictures and the bed was very comfortable.  The apartment is close to a park which was great for going for a run.  Fabian was responsive and helpful during my stay.  </P></LI>

The host Fabian is very good about staying in touch or answering any questions you have and is an all round pleasant person to talk to. May be hard to find parking later in the day.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This place was just the perfect place for my last days. 5 minutes away from the beach and a nice hour costal-drive away from the stunning north shore. Pam sets up everything really lovely. Even if she couldn't be there when I arrived - everything was waiting for me: like a bottle of water, local macadamia nuts, and a list of things to know and do.<BR />The room by the way is just so cute - the nicest one I had on Hawaii so far. And so I even had the best days of sleep here. And I really appreciate Pams flexibility - my flight leaves late, so she welcomes me to stay in the common areas of here house till than. Even if we didn't got the chance to chat that much - thank you so much Pam! </P></LI>

The place is less than 2 mins walk to the beach access. It is located in a very safe residential neighborhood. It was so peaceful and quiet. It was the best. Thank you Pam!</P></LI>

This is a great location with a big yard very close to the best family beach in Hawaii. Pam Is a terrific host. I highly recommend  this room in Pam's home as a great place to stay for a couple or for a single traveler. Enjoy Kailua!  With aloha, Peter C</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Chantal's place was really convenient for me location wise as I had both dinner and an interview nearby. Even though I did not get to meet her she had sent me directions to her home, parking info and wifi password before I got to her place. The room I got was very comfortable and the best thing was having a private bathroom for my use. If her place wasn't booked for the next day I would have stayed longer. For the price I think this place is a steal.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Pam was a wonderful host, and the bunkhouse was perfect for our group! Beds were comfortable, the endless hot water was key, and the property was great. The wifi was posted inside the house but didn't work. This wasn't an issue for us though! We played cards downstairs and enjoyed having lots of space to hang out!<BR /><BR />Pam was great in helping us out with our needs. She was easy to reach even in late and early hours. Definitely would stay here again!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This was my first airbnb experience, and it was an excellent one. My boyfriend and I came here for a laid back anniversary weekend. The setting was lovely and the wine and chocolate was a great touch. The kitchen area was greatly appreciated, as we prefer to be able to cook our breakfasts. The kitchen was nicely stocked with a few pans and even spices (though we brought our own). We did not see the host, however we did see some of the other guests that were staying in different rooms. We were able to come and go as we pleased. The only notable discrepancy I had was the plumbing. The shower would sometimes shut off while in use. It's a 'cabin' of sorts so these types of things are to be expected I feel, so it didn't bother me too much. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Juan's place is a great place in the heart of Bisbee. If you want to know what it's like to live in Bisbee, this is the place! There are tons of stairs, so be prepared (but that's how houses are built there). Parking is very tricky. You have to go up this narrow, steep, cobblestone road. Best to do it with a spotter. But if you can commit to parking and then walking for the rest of your trip, it's worth it. The house itself is very nice. It's clean and comfortable. The outdoor patio is awesome! We really enjoyed our stay. </P></LI>

The main home is a historic Victorian with one of the first privately owned pools in Tupelo. The pool was renovated on 2015 and the pool house in 2016. Located on a street with other historic homes which have been converted into offices,  the neighborhood is very quite on the weekends and evenings. Located within walking distance of downtown eating, shopping, and events. The home is located a few blocks from the Bancorpsouth Arena and Fairpark.<BR /><BR />Disclaimer: the pool is located on a tree covered lot which means it does not get much sun.

                <LI><P>Wow!!!!!! This is definitely a favorite of mine. Incredibly central yet private, comfortable and clean, relaxing and beautiful. The pool and the pool side is incredible. From the moment I showed up I was welcomed in and treated so wonderfully. I got to hang out with ricky and his family and friends. Genuinely fantastic people with a talent for creating luxurious, comfortable and beautiful spaces. The neighborhood is great too. Right down the street is fantastic authentic Haitian food!

                <LI><P>Ricky's place is great! It is beautifully decorated and just as described. It's in an upcoming area that is close to everything, and you see the "two sides" to Miami in the residential area (coming in from one side vs the other is a huge difference, you see poverty and then extreme wealth). It's very safe and private which was great for my partner and I. It is also centrally located to a lot of places (less than 7 miles usually) and we had a car (which is recommended) so we're able to go to quiet a few places that Ricky recommended. Great host!</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">Quiet residential neighborhood with private entrance, patio, parking, kitchen & bathtub & shower.  The plush couch folds to a comfortable bed.  We are a 5 - 10 min. drive from the heart of downtown and a 5 - 10 min. drive to the U of O campus.<BR /><BR />The space is elegantly decorated and furnished with comfort in mind.  The space is private and makes a great getaway.  The kitchen allows guest to cook and stay in or go out for meals.  The cottage is small and cozy.  The plush sofa folds out to a full size bed.  The mattress is a premium air mattress with quilted cover that inflates with a built in pump within 60 seconds.  Guests tell us the bed is very comfortable.  Since my husband and I live just a short walk across the backyard, we are a able to assist  with the sofa or any of our guests' needs to make your stay comfortable.<BR /><BR />Guests will enjoy their own private space with small garden and courtyard.  Guests will also be welcome to enjoy the larger garden on the premises.</DIV>

                <LI><P>I loved Barbara's cozy cottage. It was perfect for during my long conference weekend in Eugene. Every time I thought, "I wish there was…" I found it! The cottage is just the right size for one person or a couple. The kitchenette was especially handy and well stocked with gear and basic food supplies. Even though the cottage is located in a pretty adjoining garden to the back of the house, it felt very private. There’s even a small secluded patio near the cottage entrance that would be lovely to use in nice weather. I also appreciated that the main house was decorated with little white lights – that made it easy to identify where to turn when coming back in the dark. Great job from a fellow Airbnb host and traveler.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This was our first Airbnb and it was phenomenal. Our host was very accommodating and inviting. The room was very quiet and calming with a beautiful view over Birmingham. Our host was out of town the weekend we came, but went out of his way to stop by and assure we were well settled. It was overall an amazing experience and we plan to stay here again if we are ever in the area.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I have only Airbnb'd a few times, but this stay was INCREDIBLE. Kevin was a most gracious host, and an absolute pleasure to get to know. Our arrival was in the wee hours of the morning, but he woke up early and let us in to get settled without complaint. In our time there we were able to hang out with him a fair amount, and he was very helpful in guiding us around Birmingham. He also provided us with coffee and breakfast, which was a super kind gesture. The space was immaculate, from the beds to the bathroom. Impeccably renovated, decorated, and cleaned. Should we make our way back to Birmingham, we will ABSOLUTELY be staying with Kevin, and his sweet little dog Remy!</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">Welcome to our renovated 1969 Airstream located in the heart of Lafayette! <BR /><BR />You are only 2 blocks from Downtown and several blocks from ULL with over a dozen restaurants within walking distance. Art, live music, & much more are all extremely close. <BR /><BR />We are located only blocks from the Greyhound station & less than 3 miles from the airport.<BR /><BR />We have an extensive list of recommendations for things to do in Lafayette & look forward to hosting you! Feel free to contact with any questions.<BR /><BR />This 1969 Airstream was previously purchased in rural Missisippi and over the last year I have been renovating/restoring it. I tried to re-use/re-purpose as many of the original elements as possible while giving it an updated feel. Inside it has a 3 burner stove (along with pans & everything you need for cooking), two full beds, small fridge/freezer, microwave, a hot water kettle for tea (along with tea to enjoy), and we also give you a few beers & granola bars t</DIV>

                <LI><P>This place is great! I got a little turned around when initially finding it, not realizing I kept passing it up. I gad to call to get directions and my host, Jason, was so nice and guided me there in a snap!  Once I got there though I realized how great the location is. Its very close to all the fun of downtown Lafayette but far enough to not have to deal with the noise of everything once you want to settle down for the night.  The airstream itself was very nice and clean with amenities such as tea, Luna bars, and beer provided (in my case, strawberry beer ) as well as shampoo and conditioner and nice towels.  I am 5'6 on a good day and this place was the perfect ceiling height for me (about 1ft- 1 1/2 ft above my head. It seemed spacious and bright in the morning too. I had an excellent time in Lafayette but my time here was definitely the best part.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Having never stayed in an Airstream before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect...Jason could not have been more communicative and helpful. The stay was a pleasure. The Airstream was both cozy and surprisingly spacious. It was very comfortable and there were several restaurants and things to do within walking distance. It was also great to just sit out on the deck and relax. I'll definitely be looking for an excuse to return as soon as possible. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>The super quaint vintage Airstream was a lot of fun to stay in and way bigger than I expected (Two of us comfortably stayed here). If the weather is good be sure to open the windows and enjoy the fresh air (They and the door have bug screens!). The local beer in the fridge was a nice touch! The location is super close to downtown and easy to get about Lafayette. BUT the biggest asset here is our host, Jason. He is friendly, helpful, very responsive, and overall a fantastic host. He also knows the city quite well if you need a recommendation, is a professional photog, and a musician (He's probably got more skills but we were only there two nights). All in all, a very positive experience/trip.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Bryan's place was great. He allowed us to drop off our luggage in the morning and check in later in the afternoon which we greatly appreciated. Check-in was easy since Bryan gave us a key code for the front door. The house is close to bus stops on Government and Normal and also a 10 minute walk to CATS terminal so it's easy to get downtown and back by bus. We only stayed one night but met Bryan, his wife, and his wonderful dogs. The bedroom is nothing special but it gave us a good night's sleep.</P></LI>

My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.<BR /><BR />I also have a security system.<BR /><BR />You must park down the driveway on the concrete close to the fence and grass on the right hand side. This makes it easier for me to get my car out of the garage.<BR /><BR />I will greet you when you check in and will assist you with any directions or locations.<BR /><BR />My neighborhood has a community pool that is accessible during the summer as well as an exercise gym.<BR /><BR />There are 2 bedrooms that share a jack and Jill bath and another bedroom with a complete bath.<BR />There is a screened in porch with a tv and eating area overlooking the woods.</DIV>

                <LI><P>Elisa's place is so welcoming and immaculate.  I talked to her once or twice when I was there and she was super sweet and accommodating, and even had breakfast treats out each morning!  I had some issues getting in due to inclement weather, and she was quick to communicate, and even refunded me a night because I literally could not get there from the airport. She could not have been nicer about the whole situation! <BR /><BR />My bedroom was super clean and private and smelled amazing.  I think that bed is literally the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in.  Seriously, haha.  <BR />She has a key-code security system that makes it super easy to come and go, which I loved. <BR /><BR />The surrounding area is very nice and beautiful just like her home!  Pretty secluded, but I loved the nature and surroundings on my drive to and from the house.<BR /><BR />I highly recommend Elissa's place!  I will definitely be staying with her again when I go out to visit my family again! :) </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Elisa has a beautiful home and a great system for welcoming visitors, even if you check-in after hours like we did. We had to rush out in the morning, but Elisa was kind enough to offer us breakfast as we were leaving. The room and bathroom were very clean and the towels were super-soft. It was a little bit of a drive back to her house, but it was a nice, quiet neighborhood.</P></LI>

Many community churches nearby.  CVS,  Dollar General, Chevron in walking distance.<BR /><BR />Nice corner lot to sit and enjoy a peaceful sunset.<BR /><BR />As my guest, you have access to a large enclosed backyard fence. Great for barbeques and<BR /><BR /> for kids to play.<BR /><BR />Sometimes, I would be available to offer assistance if needed.<BR /><BR />My neighborhood is quiet and people smile but don't intrude upon each other. The school bus lets off students in the evening within 20 feet of the house.<BR /><BR />Public transportation is not available.<BR />Uber is always available.<BR /><BR />There are wild flower that bloom in the spring. Trash is very minimal unless we get an unannounced litter bug.</DIV>

                <LI><P>Perfect stay! Melanie made us feel so welcome and made our travel plans as easy as can be. The space is so comfortable and centrally located; just a few minute drive into the main area of town with dining and shopping and was perfect for our 3 day stay in town for exploring wineries in Napa, Sonoma and Calistoga. Highly recommend and would definitely stay again!! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights and could not have had a more positive experience! The cottage is quaint and cozy, everything is updated and a perfect space for two. We were very impressed with the small details in the cottage such as a welcome basket with treats and a sweet note, a plethora of fresh towels, updated amenities, and a list of recommendations in the area. We arrived later in the evening - Easy check in was a breeze! The location is great and within a quick distance to the Plaza, Glen Ellen, and only 40 minutes to Napa. We had no issues, but Melanie was just a quick text away. We had such a great experience and will definitely be back. Thank you Melanie for the wonderful getaway in wine country!!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>The cottage was beautiful and was stocked with everything anyone could possibly need for a comfortable stay. The neighborhood was quiet and away from busy streets and at the same time a conveniently short distance from many great restaurants, markets, and wineries. This is a great place to stay if you are traveling solo or with a significant other; the cottage is very intimate.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This lovely little guest studio behind Melanie's house was the perfect choice for our visit to Napa/Sonoma. As others have commented, it is cozy but very well-appointed with everything you could possibly need for a lovely stay. Bed was very comfortable. Melanie greeted us warmly with a smile and a hug and was very responsive to any inquiries we had.  The location was perfect for our jaunts to Napa for the wine train and a day trip to Calistoga. This is the epitome of an AirBnB stay......</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I had a nightmare flying experience and spent over 16 hours in airports thanks to delays. I flew into SJC a day later than expected and in the middle of the night. So I contacted 20+ air b n bs in the area for a place to rest and Tiger was the only one who made an easy, self check in possible. The area is safe, conveniently located by 280, and is exactly what the photos show. Perfect place for a quiet and clean place to sleep.    </P></LI>

Bring your own shampoo, hand wash etc.<BR />Tiger was responsive as while check-in in night, it was too dark to use the lock-box to get the keys but he promptly fixed it next day.

This cozy space has a private entrance, private bedroom w/ large closet, private bathroom, private living/dining area with futon, and personal kitchenette. The laundry is occasionally shared with the owner. Conveniently located minutes walking distance from downtown, restaurants, music venues, and 10 minute drive from the airport.<BR /><BR />I'm very excited to open my home to visitors from all over! I am a first-time home owner and have divided my house in two - I live in one half, and the other half is my Airbnb.<BR /><BR />Private entrance with keypad lock - no keys needed! Private bedroom, living/dining room, & bathroom. Personal kitchenette & shared laundry. Kitchenette/laundry has a refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave, dishes, and full sized washer and dryer. The laundry is shared with the owner only, and has its own entrance, as not to intrude on your space.<BR /><BR />We may see each other coming and going from time to time, or when I'm doing laundry. If you need any</DIV>

                <LI><P>Carlos could not have been more accommodating, hospitable, and professional.  I was truly thrilled with our experience at his home. It was immaculately kept, modern yet classic, and made to feel our own. <BR />Carlos showed his true kindness when my fiancé and arrived a few hours before our scheduled arrival time (traveling can confuse the best of us) and yet Carlos quickly turned over our room and allowed us to settle in. The self check in and out was also much appreciated. <BR />The location couldn't be better, either. His home is walking distance to many restaurants and bars catering to the ASU and Tempe community.  We were a moderate drive to Peoria where we watched a couple Mariners games and a 45 or so minute drive to great hiking at the Superstition Mountains. <BR />We will definitely look to staying with Carlos in the future and I recommend you do the same. </P></LI>

The neighborhood is amazing and in a very convenient location and we were able to find the house easily as the lights were left on for us. We didn't have time to meet Carlos or Beia but we had a very comfortable stay. I would recommend staying here.</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">My place is close to downtown Tempe, Tempe Town lake, Mill Avenue shops/restaurants, and within walking distance of ASU. It is just a 10 min drive from downtown Phoenix and old town Scottsdale. You’ll love my place because of the location, the coziness, and the amenities provided. The apartment is furnished with a simple elegance and is great to relax in after a long day of exploring the valley. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers, and anything in between.<BR /><BR />It is a spacious 1 bedroom/studio with a minimalist/elegant style.<BR /><BR />You will have access to every part of the apt but I do have my personal belongings in the closet across from the bathroom. Please respect my things and this area. The complex itself has laundry onsite which I would be willing to help you access for a fee.<BR /><BR />I will be often available after 5pm on weekdays and all day on the weekend. I live on the floor below in the same building.<BR /><BR />The neighborh</DIV>

            <DIV class="description">This hidden garden studio is so peaceful you won't even feel like you are in the city. Yet, still just a short walk to shopping or drive to downtown St. Paul. <BR /><BR />925 sq ft apartment is in the lower level of a family home with a private entrance in a quiet neighborhood. Its full kitchen is stocked with a Keurig and all the cookware to make a gourmet meal. Relax in front of the 60" TV, by the gas fireplace or even take a walk on the beautiful snowy Bruce Vent trail.<BR /><BR />We love to meet new people!<BR /><BR />You will have full access to the lower level studio apartment and a parking spot reserved for you in the driveway. You will also have access to a shared backyard and garden area.<BR /><BR />We love to visit a little bit when you first arrive and chat in passing, but overall keep things nice and casual. If there is something you need help with or would like to do with us, just ask and we would be happy to join in.<BR /><BR />The neighborhood is great and full of many </DIV>

                <LI><P>This was the perfect place for a weekend get away. Amanda was a generous host from the Netflix available on the TV to the chocolates on the bedside pillows. She was always available incase we needed anything. Very close to downtown St. Paul and great restaurants. Can't wait to come back to Minnesota and visit soon!!!</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">This private bungalow is steps from the wide Ewa Beach oceanfront. Great for water sports, sunbathing, splashing in the water and playing in the silky sand. Detached from the main house and in a completely independent dwelling, affording privacy and comfort during your stay on Oahu. No ocean view from the unit but is surrounded by lush foliage, and the beach is just a short 50 ft walk on a secluded path through the ferns out to the ocean/cabana. Private property and no public access is allowed.<BR /><BR />Full Kitchen, 2 dining tables for your comfort, one is indoors and one is outdoors on a covered patio surrounded by huge palms and lush ferns. Shuttered windows all around provide balmy breezes flowing all through the bungalow. King size bed with crisp linens, tiled step-in shower and all the beach supplies you will need for a great time. Tropical birds singing all day and the sound of the ocean waves will relax you during your stay at our serene and heavily forested beachfront proper</DIV>

                <LI><P>If you're looking for a cozy and lived-in space, this is the room for you!  The room is very clean and well decorated.  Our hosts traveled a lot too so you'll get to see all the cool travel memorabilia. It was awesome to see some stuffs from when they traveled to my hometown! Hosts are quick to respond to questions, very friendly and welcoming.  They even gave me a tour of the space and the rooftop with a phenomenal view.  Parking can be an issue but there are some tips in their notes. We took Lyft everywhere which is quick and cheap because we're in the center of everything. There are tons of stores right around the corner of this building and a 7-Eleven a couple steps away for anything you might need. I would highly recommend this place!</P></LI>

And the neighborhood is quiet.<BR /><BR />Shiori responded quickly to any question or concern. <BR /><BR />It is close to a lot of things. In 2 days We were able to get to the beach, Hanauma Bay, Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor, Makapu'u Lookout, and Koko Crater Botanical Gardens. <BR /><BR />There are grocery stores and restaurants nearby.

            <DIV class="description">Wonderful (tiny) space set amidst green pastures and along the famous San Pedro River.  Hiking, birding, and sightseeing!<BR /><BR />WARNING:  Restroom is a (nice) outhouse, FYI!  This is rustic cabin on a ranch far from town.  Please read directions/details and be aware that rain or inclement weather may make travel to/from the ranch more difficult.<BR /><BR />It's on a working ranch, there are cows and workers! We do not have someone to specifically meet cabin guests, so it is a serve-yourself setup. We are available by phone if needed.<BR /><BR />You have the whole cabin to yourself. Feel free to walk around areas around the cabin, and it's especially lovely to walk down the river bed when it is dry (which is most of the time).<BR /><BR />You're on your own, we'll tell you where the key is...<BR /><BR />The nearest towns are Dudleyville and Winkelman, several miles north of the ranch. The location itself is remote, so it's best to come prepared if you don't want to travel to and fro</DIV>

                <LI><P>The cabin is nice enough and the surrounding desert is beautiful, but be sure to pack like you will be camping. We didn't have electricity on the second day and couldn't use any of the kitchen appliances to prepare food. The road into the ranch crosses a riverbed, and you will want to have a high-clearance vehicle during and after inclement weather (and maybe at other times as well; we were there during a rainy spell). There is plenty of opportunity to spend time outside, but we didn't find a terribly conducive spot. It's difficult to move through the river bottom near the ranch, so hiking is somewhat limited except along the road. Lots of wildlife though and definitely a quiet place to pause and reflect.  </P></LI>

                <LI><P>The guest house was exactly what me and a friend were looking for, the price is very reasonable and the scenery is phenomenal. If you enjoy stargazing there is zero light pollution, every constellation was as clear as could be. <BR /><BR />There were several very friendly cats that loved to visit us, one caught us a moth and left it at the doorstep as a gift. <BR /><BR />The description is very accurate, don't expect to have a 5-star hotel, just a perfect little home base to lie your head and look at the stars through the window, or curl up with a good book.<BR /><BR />Though we didn't bring anything perishable we were pleasantly surprised to find a mini fridge inside in case you have something small that needs to be refrigerated.<BR /><BR />Hope to visit again some day, had a very good experience.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Annie is the ideal host! Anything you need is either already in the condo, or you could easily pick up from the Walmart around the corner or the Walgreens across the street. Annie was also quick with her replies, and if we had needed her for anything we wouldn't have hesitated to ask. Because it's downtown, street parking was a no-go, which left us to garage parking. If you played your cards right though, it would only be $8 overnight which was still way cheaper than what we had paid before at Waikiki. Make sure you get food before you head back in for the night as well, considering a majority of the places within walking distance close really early- like 6 pm. All in all, the place was super nice, comfortable, and luxurious, we felt safe the entire time and we would definitely stay there again! </P></LI>

This is a VINTAGE BUNGALOW with some lovely updates. </P></LI>

The bed is comfy and the room is accomodating. Her art is very pleasant and comes in many forms. You can really tell that she cares about her guests and is an altogether good person. Stay here! Don't give it a second thought.</P></LI>

The location is close to good eating and a variety of clubs in downtown Lafayette. I was in town for a travel seminar after which I walked the few blocks to a really cool beer garden. This place is a gem!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>My wife and I were very impressed with our first stay in an Airbnb rental. It was wonderful. We had a very restful time and will surely stay here anytime we are traveling through Tupelo. We felt very secure. Vince's place is walking distance to many of Tupelo's attraction yet it is still very secluded in a very upscale neighborhood. We couldn't have asked for better. Thank you Vince!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Our group included my 81 year old mom and 16 year old son. The Barbecue Festival took place in his back yard (so to speak) But inside Vincent's home was quiet and peaceful.  Vincent was so genuine and pleasant. And his home is beautiful and comfortable.<BR />We truly enjoyed our stay!<BR /><BR /></P></LI>

                <LI><P>Jay and Melissa are as accommodating as hosts can be. From the booking, they gave us a plethora of information and details about their listing and Napa so we would arrive informed and comfortable. <BR /><BR />The listing itself was very accommodating. Cozy yet spacious for two. It's secluded from the main home, so no need to tip toe or whisper. Cozy bed, lovely living space, and a nice porch for good weather. <BR /><BR />Less than a 10 minutes walk to the heart of downtown. We parked our car the night we arrived and never moved it until we left 3 days later. <BR /><BR />If we ever do Napa again, we're looking for this listing again!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Jay is a superb host. He was quick to respond to all questions and offered us many helpful recommendations to ensure we experienced the best Napa has to offer. The house is just as described and photographed. Features we especially appreciated: off street parking, washer/dryer (with detergent, etc), comfortable, clean and modern furnishings, Keyless entry. Had the weather been better we would have taken advantage of the walk to downtown and cute, private patio. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>This place was spectacular. Easy walking distance to southern end of downtown Napa. Ample parking near the home if you needed to drive. The home itself is nestled in the back end of the property and so very quiet. Also since it's almost brand new, sound proofing and current design specs make the house very well thought-out in terms of features and amenities. I'm definitely considering staying here again when I come to Napa for the weekend. Mahalo Jay and Jessica for being such awesome guests with such a lovely little cottage. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Our family really enjoyed this place as a nice break from the cookie cutter hotels. It is a real southern house with a big porch and plenty of room inside and out. Old fashioned would probably be the phrase I would use to describe it. We were only passing through but it would be a great place for a retreat or some time away in peace and quiet. The price was very good. We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Emily's place is conveniently located within walking distance to all the downtown restaurants and nightlife. The house is older so don't expect the Hilton. But do expect it to be clean and comfortable. Emily was an excellent host. We couldn't be there to greet her at 3pm check in so she left the key where we could find it<BR />She has local numbers and places written down if you don't know the area. And even allowed us a late check out(because it worked with her schedule) as we wanted to sleep in. <BR />I'd recommend Emily's house if you looking to be able to go out downtown and drink and be able to walk and not drive.!!! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>I took a bachelorette party to Lafayette for the weekend, and we had a great time at Emily's. While not fancy, it was clean and comfortable. She made up the beds and futon for us, which was very nice! The location was walkable to a few bars and restaurants, and it was 5 minute drive to the rest of town. We enjoyed hanging out at the eat-in kitchen. Lots of natural light in the house! The price was so reasonable, and Emily answered all of my questions. I would totally recommend this host and house!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Great value in a great location! This little guest house is a great alternative to paying very high prices for a hotel in this area. Check-in was very easy and we were even able to check in a bit early. It felt private and comfortable and the space was clean. All of the basics were available. The bedding was comfortable and we loved that there were extra pillows. The only minor issue was that there was only one set of towels so one of us had to use a damp towel. It was a very good experience overall and we would both recommend it to others and stay there again. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>The picture with the spa on the deck tells the story. This is a great place to stay while enjoying the leeward side of Oahu. The appearance of this home from the street is deceiving. Don't let this turn you away. Once inside you'll be taken in by the view and the very cool interior decoration. Jim collects vintage furnishings and he and Maki have decorated the interior in an attractive and artful manner.
<BR />
<BR />Of course, it's the hosts that make or break a stay at an AirBnB. Maki and Jim made us feel right at home. Maki makes delicious and creative breakfasts. 
<BR />
<BR />Keep in mind that you're not right in a town. The nearest Starbucks is a  5 to 10 minute drive.  One of the features we liked was that most everything we wanted to see or do was within 30 minutes. On the other hand, depending on how you look at it, everything is at least 30 minutes away. No problem for us.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I and my wife stayed in Jim&Maki's house for our first travel in Hawaii. They are very nice and their house was great especially for couples. Maki's breakfast was perfectly fit for us and really yummy. She cooks only using organic vegis, which makes us healthy in the morning. One day, we got together. Jim let me know how I can cook his secret Steak that was fantastic flavor with red wine. I will never forget our staying with them. If anyone would like to stay in O'ahu island, I will definitely recommend Jim&Maki's house ! Their house is located in the center of island, which is very convenient to drive to any place in the island. The house and room are exactly the same as in photo. We have no problems with laundary, shower, cooking, and so on. Neiborhood is very quite, so that we sleep deeply. Thank U Jim and Maki ! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Jim and Maki's place was great, they are wonderful hosts, they made us feel welcome, and woke up everyday with an excelent breakfast. =P
<BR />The place was clean,the beds comfy, and provide us with towels, beach chair, etc.
<BR />The location was ok, it's an easy drive anywhere. The jacuzzi was always ready to use, clean and with hot water, to relax after a long beach day.
<BR />Jim and Maki are beyond friendly and accommodating, which made  our stay exceptional.
<BR />It is a great place to stay, and I highly recommend it for anybody.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Jim was amazing and his home is beautiful. He met us upon check-in and showed us around his well preserved, historic home. Jim was so welcoming, friendly, and interesting we just sat and chatted with him for a while. Honestly, we could have chatted all night but we needed food. Jim suggested Weidmann's, a really great restaurant nearby (sit on the balcony in the balcony bar!) that has been there since 1870!, and it didn't disappoint. The room is pretty stunning and much bigger than the photos show. You basically have a whole, private wing of the house, including a bedroom, living room (with a daybed separate from the bedroom), private bathroom, and kitchenette. All to yourself! You are also provided with plenty of linens, and a Keurig. We really appreciated how charming and unique this home is. <BR /><BR />Happy travels!! </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Great house with so much character. Jim went over and beyond what was expected. I'm a tennis coach and brought my 9 year old and 7 year to compete in a tennis tournament in Meridian. We cooked  meals and enjoyed the house as much as our busy scheduled allowed. Jim's house is going to be a real winner on airbnb. I was coaching 8 other families who all over paid for hotels in Meridian and when they saw the room my family had they were extremely jealous. I've stayed in Airbnb's all over the world as a professional tennis coach and this was by far the most historic and unique stay I've had. It was also my wife's first stay in an airbnb and she was a little apprehensive at first. It took no time for her to get hooked. Glad to know when we travel as a family all of us will pick airbnb! Thanks Jim!</P></LI>

You are welcome to sit on the front porch too.<BR /><BR />I am an Uber driver and I have my own lawn service. I'm usually running the roads. But when I do see you, I enjoy nice talks and learning about where you are from.<BR /><BR />I love this location because my neighbors are extremely friendly and always more than willing to help.<BR /><BR />Uber is your best bet for transit in Lafayette if you have no vehicle.

                <LI><P>Travis was extremely flexible with my arrival time. Travis and his friend helped get my bags out of the car, and another friend made me a nice beverage. I felt very welcomed. <BR /><BR />I enjoyed the comfort of the bed and I guess we got lucky and booked on a weekend where we were the only guests, which was great for us because we did not have to share the bathroom with any other guests.<BR /><BR /> I would stay again.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Travis is a generous host who knows his city very well, and is willing to spend time to help you learn about the area and get to where you want to go. The room was clean and comfortable, and the kitchen well equipped enough to do some basic cooking, and cleaning up. There is a lovely front porch swing to sit on and chat, or just watch the city. This home near the university is within walking distance of a big beautiful city park that we visited all three days we were in town. We loved the security system on the door because we didn't have to worry about carrying an extra key. Dependable off street parking is a plus too.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>There are two other rooms that get rented out so the share places feels a little untidy sometimes. But the room itself was clean and was fine. The house is on a busy street so there is a bit of traffic noise. It was nice being able to use a washer and dryer and a kitchen too. Travis was nice and checked whenever he did see us if things were fine. </P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">Comfortable, spacious room for you to feel at home awaits! Built in 1911, our home offers old world charm with modern feel. You are invited to enjoy practically the whole house, especially our favorite room, the kitchen! You will have off-street parking and your own mini-fridge. It's just a short walk/bike/drive to wonderful places around St. Paul, to I-94/the Green Line that connects you to Minneapolis, and 4 blocks away is the Nice Ride bike-sharing station.<BR /><BR />The house was originally built in 1911, and like most homes in this area, in the last hundred+ years it has been updated and curated to fit the needs and tastes of its owners. When we first bought the house, Hannah and I fell in love with the character of the aged oak woodwork, nine foot ceilings, antique radiators, and well-loved original Hardrock Maple floors. Unlike many older homes though, Capitol Heights has been updated with a more modern, flowing floor-plan that creates cozy nooks inside sweeping spaces. During </DIV>

                <LI><P>Not bad for a quick in and out stay. I was unaware before I got to the house that the only parking options were to take a chance on a parking ticket or park 3 blocks down in the cold and walk back (don't forget anything), I took a chance on the parking ticket. The head of the bed had a decline so that your head it tilted backwards and the flat pillows did not help. To bedroom was up against the living room/bedroom and could hear much of the voices and music and feel the bass. As well the only access to the bedroom was through the dining room which the residents were using with friends around 8/9pm and were not regarding any noise concerns.  </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Had a comfortable stay here. First Airbnb so I wasn't sure what to expect and have nothing to compare this experience to. The price was good for the stay -- some things were lacking IN ROOM like cups/water... and communication, but overall it wasn't a deal breaker and I would stay again. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Wow, first it was an economical rate, 22$ per night, and there were no cleaning fees or hidden nickle and dime additions - which has happened a few times in the past under the AirBnB system. It was a straight up rate.<BR /><BR />Bill is a straight up man of integrity. This is what made my stay so wonderful. <BR /><BR />I have stayed at many hostels around the world with similar rates, but you have to put up with a lot more crap, such as kitchens that are dirty, missing appliances, using a nasty dormitory room with snoring, and clothes around the floor, and there have been many other guests who are both well-mannered and ill-mannered. I also include the hostel staff in this smorgasbord. I also used Couchsurfing some years ago, and I met a few marvelous people through it, but lately the site, and the people running it have messed up its system. AirBnB has taken the slack and created a new way to visit new places - and it has marvelous gems like Bill's place in Globe.</P></LI>

There is a full bath in the back with shower(the basin of the shower is an old fashioned #2 washtub) ,full size toilet and sink(basin is a little pail).<BR /><BR />Both ends of the cabin are lofted and my plans are to put a bed in each side.As of now the sleeping arrangements consist of a recliner,a couch,and an inflatable mattress.If you are interested in tiny home living,then you should try a night in my cabin.I go up there often just because I like the feel of my tiny home. The kitchen sink is not finished yet but will be soon.There is a nice flatscreen with antenna TV and I also have a pretty good DVD selection there(or just hit a redbox on your way).There is a small fridge,microwave,crock pot, and hotplate as well </DIV>

I felt very safe in their house and neighborhood. And the cats are so sweet. I would definitely stay with them anytime I return to Jackson.</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">My place is close to all the offerings of Napa Valley. A short walk to downtown & a close drive to the vineyards, hiking & picnic spots.  You’ll love my place because of your private room with bathroom & your own entrance; it's a comfortable spotlessly clean, safe & beautiful wine country escape. Enjoy the sitting area watching tv or movies or go out on your patio to enjoy a glass of wine under the stars.  There's a lovely community pool for a refreshing dip. Perfect for quiet respectful guests.<BR /><BR />My home is decorated in a country-elegant wine country style, that will not only make you feel comfortable, but also pampered.  Fresh coffee, tea and bottled water is provided. Your comfort is my priority.<BR /><BR />I am often away at work during the day, but I am readily available by phone.<BR /><BR />There is a public bus system in Napa as well as taxi's, Evan's Airport Transportation, Lift and Uber.

                <LI><P>I can't say enough good things about Jane and her place.  <BR /><BR />The place was just as described and represented a really good value in a location that often has tight hotel inventory and very high prices.  The home is in a quiet neighborhood, but just a short walk to downtown Napa and all of the restaurants and shops there.  Getting to St. Helena highway and Silverado were very easy as well.    <BR />  <BR />Jane's communication both prior to and during the stay was excellent.  She provided recommendations for things to do in the Napa Valley area and also gave two-spot on dinner restaurant suggestions.<BR /><BR />I'd highly recommend Jane's place to anyone planning a Napa trip and look forward to staying there again in the future.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Room is clean with private bath. Nice towels soaps etc.   nice TV and Jane has many nice touches in terms of decorating, books for reading, movies for TV, coffee.   Jane is a warm accommodating host.  <BR />Even though The room has a private bath, it is across hall and close to host bedrooms.  Even though it technically has private entrance from outside, you need to climb a narrow metal spiral staircase to get to door.  In order to carry luggage to room you need to enter through hosts main entrance and go through their living area to access your bedroom.  Older people will not be comfortable using spiral outside entrance at all so they will not really have private entrance.  </P></LI>

                <LI><P>My gf and I loved this place, and it was a deal too. Jane was an excellent host: gave great local recs in advance, very friendly all the way through, and totally respected our privacy. This is a bit more than a 1Br/1Ba because the place is outfitted with everything you could want for a short stay (mini fridge, keureg, microwave, toaster oven, and water cooler) and there are TWO step out balconies, one of which is nice and sunny in the morning; so my gf and I enjoyed doing a quick breakfast there before heading out to wineries or wherever. We ended up driving the ~1 mile into downtown Napa the night we did go check it out, but you def could walk. The property is set in a really quiet little suburban section, so very peaceful at night and pretty stars too. We'll totally go back.</P></LI>

The house is a lovely place and the room was one of the best Air BnB experiences I've had yet - she thought of everything one may need during a stay. I highly recommend!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We HIGHLY recommend this Airbnb!!!!!! Deb and Doug's lovely home was the perfect start to our romantic anniversary getaway.  The room feels very private and cozy with a luxurious bed and sleek bathroom. They thought of absolutely everything and more - from extra toiletries, bottled water, and a wine fridge to 2 for 1 winery coupons. Free coffee and tea. The jacuzzi tub was a perfect way to relax after a day of wine tasting. Downtown is a 5 minute drive away and all the wineries are an easy, beautiful drive. Deb and Doug were available for anything we needed yet respected our privacy. We had a great time getting to know them and their adorable kitties. </P></LI>

We love the convenient walk to the beach as well as the washer and dryer on site. She also added a new fold out sofa bed since our last stay which was super convenient for our group. We will be back again! :) </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Cara's place was perfect for my husband, me, and our 1.5-year-old daughter. She loved running around the yard and eating on the patio. Cara was thoughtful to set out a child's table and chairs, and my daughter loved it. We loved pulling her to the beach every morning in the red wagon. Easy driving distance to Whole Foods and great eating options.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We were supposed to stay at Jordan's place for one night, but ended up cancelling last minute since my boyfriend got sick in Honolulu and decided it was best to stay there and rest. Jordan was very flexible with our last minute changes, and he even offered us a different night to stay at his place. Unfortunately, this didn't happen since we had to fly out, but I will definitely want to visit his place the next time I visit Oahu. Thank you!</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">This is a large room on the second floor of a 1925 two-story house. With 5 large windows, it faces southwest and gets a lot of afternoon sun; the room has an air-conditioning unit in the summer, though the house itself is not air-conditioned. There is a queen-sized bed and a single bed in the room, and there is also a table and chair and lamp for lap-top work. The bathroom has a shower and is usually shared with other guests.<BR /><BR />This is a larger older house (1925) in a residential neighborhood on Red Mountain. The house has two living rooms that are fairly large and a front and back porch, a fairly big kitchen and a back room with a washer and dryer.<BR /><BR />Guests are welcome to use the living rooms. They are welcome as well to use the kitchen (and washing machine for longer stays), but we would appreciate it if you would let us know in advance your wishes for using the kitchen so we can coordinate.<BR /><BR />We will be around the house during guest stays, and we are glad </DIV>

                <LI><P>Robin and Haynes are incredibly sweet, approachable and helpful. They offer a lot of great recommendations about things to do, and Robin is very prompt with her responses about check-in and information about her place. An added plus is that her dogs are very adorable and friendly. And as someone with a mild allergy to dog dandur, I had no trouble and didn't sneeze once. The place is very clean and cozy. The house is very close to the Vulcan Trail, so if you are someone who enjoys a good view and nice walk, I'd highly recommend staying in the area. </P></LI>

We also were able to hang out at the pool after checkout because our flight was a couple of hours later.  Overall, great experience.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Charming and cozy.  A really unique experience (assuming you've never stayed in an Airstream) but has all the amenities you might need and a wonderfully comfortable bed.  A fantastic option for a special and unique place to stay in Napa.  If you've bookmarked this place and are considering it among other options, BOOK IT.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This is a most memorable, delightful place to stay. It was cozy, comfortable, very clean and decorated with a loving, artistic eye. The bed was like a nest. The flat screen TV was a plus, along with lovingly kept chickens and kitties outside. A darling wine train makes a visit just past the fence once (not during the night). Tom and Judy are lovely, welcoming hosts who are very prompt and easy to communicate with. They gave us a great restaurant suggestion as well. It was very close to restaurants and the Uptown Theatre in Napa.</P></LI>

The chicken coop in back, covered seating area, and their sweet cat Jax really added to the experience. Definitely recommend and will be back soon! <BR /></P></LI>

I was pleasantly surprised by the host providing cables for charging which was very helpful.  If you don't drive, there are a couple of bus stops near the apartment which makes things more convenient. Communication with the host was clear which helped with finding the place, just use the picture and map that they provide and not the one on airbnb </P></LI>

There were nice finishing touches such as good quality towels and toilet paper. The host was not staying there so we did not meet Veronica but her communication was fine. There are two bedrooms and both are rented out through Air BnB so there was another couple staying there while we were there.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We really enjoyed our stay at Veronica's space! We arrived at around midnight and found the place without any problem, thanks to the direction that she provided. The bedroom and bathroom was newly renovated, modern, and very clean. We stayed for 3 nights to visit the Universal Studio, and it was easy to get there using app-based transportation. There's also bus stops right in front of the apartment complex, but we haven't got a chance to try it. Such a great value for what we pay! Thank you Veronica!</P></LI>

It was a great environment to hang out with new people and also have some quiet time. Amelia is great to talk to and to learn from about what's going on in the area. Close to Birmingham which I unfortunately didn't get to explore this time around.</P></LI>

My husband and i can give u tips on different locations around. Daughter knows hiking and swimming locations  we are close to bus stops but in a small valley, so there is a hill if you're walking. Also, there are feral chickens.</DIV>

                <LI><P>Lani's house was central and not far from the airport. About a half hour away from most places and attractions. Lani was benevolent and hospitable. She didn't hesitate to help us with anything we asked for or needed. We also met her family and they were nice too! We were out most of the time and she understood and respected that. She even washed our clothes while we were out! This place is PERFECT for people who visit Oahu to go out and explore the island but don't want to sit by a pool all day. Thanks, Lani!!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Joanna and her husband are extremely kind.<BR /><BR />We arrived late and they were waiting for us (they knew we didn't have internet connection for communications.)<BR /><BR />Our room was big and we were able to sleep with windows open. There is no external noise whatsoever. <BR /><BR />Their home is about 20-25 min from the airport. I suggest to avoid taking the highway after office hours. You risk to get stuck in traffic for quite a bit.<BR /><BR />Definitely I will return to Joanna's place on my next trip to O'hau.<BR /><BR />Mahalo,<BR />Davide & Ben.</P></LI>

I honestly felt like one of there family members while staying with them. They even fed me a delicious BBQ dinner. This is a great way to experience the loving nature of the Hawaiian people. </P></LI>

I was in town for music audition, and they fortunately had a little upright to play around on. Simple furnishing, no frills. I liked waking up to the view out of the window, which looks out to their backyard and lovely tree. Great value. Recommended for low maintenance travelers/visitors!</P></LI>

The house has a large den and dining room as well as a game room, (with pool table and dart board),that is all done in rough cut pine such as you would see in a hunting lodge. I have many deer,fish,and turkey mounts throughout the house as well.You will have access to all of the common areas of the home.<BR /><BR />We live on a 50 acre farm surrounded by fields and woods. The back side of the property is wooded  so it's great for exploring.

We didn't meet Denise as she was having fun in the Canary Islands. :)  She left great instructions and responded quickly to any questions.  Alice was there to take care of anything that needed the personal touch.  There were videos, internet, books, games, toys, extra linen, bathroom essentials. It was decorated in a bright cheerful whimsical style.  Bisbee is a fun town to visit and this place is priced great!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Wow, where to begin.....First of all, we had an wonderful stay at a spot - on place to stay. I am pretty picky and realistic when it comes to experiences like this and I can say with sincere conviction that I felt as if this was a custom-made house stay for me, my wife and our beloved pooch. The house is funky, upbeat, colorful as advertised in a unique town in a unique spot accessible to all that we desired. Surprisingly quiet, tranquil, a genuinely friendly neighbor Linda, we loved the fenced in front and back yards for our dog (he is very picky too and seemed at home immediately!). The bed was comfy, the shower nice and hot (important for me!), after all our adventures we were able to relax in the living room as if it was our own and watch an obscure movie on Netflix, great wifi, great cell phone reception (who would think in the middle of a copper mine??). We didn't do any cooking, but were tempted by the gas stove, and did enjoy the comfort of fresh ground coffee because how did t</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We stayed here for the weekend so we could explore both Bisbee and Tombstone. We chose Bisbee as there were more vegetarian dining options for us, than in Tombstone. Glad we did as Bisbee is a fun and friendly little place and was the perfect base. We were also glad we stayed outside of Old Bisbee, as it can be fairly noisy in the evening. Denise's place is a short drive away and offered us a quiet spot to leave our crated dog while we ate out and enjoyed tours that were not dog-friendly. We also had no qualms about walking our dog around the neighborhood in the dark. The house itself is quirky and well-equipped, plus we appreciated the private little fenced patio area directly outside the back door. Linda, who lives across the street, greeted us when we arrived and showed us where to park (off-street, alongside the house). She told us that if we needed anything to let her know, but since everything had been taken care of, we just settled in and enjoyed our weekend. If you prefer a qui</P></LI>

Lovely, welcoming country retreat provides all the comforts of home.<BR />Beautiful property located in a quiet neighborhood at the end of the street. We sat on the patio each morning and enjoyed our coffee taking in the scenery and sounds of nature. I shared this residence with my parents and adult sibling; plenty of room.  We will definitly stay here again the next time we are in Newton!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I can't say enough about this property. My husband and I are frequent airbnbers but only after in-depth study of our needs and hosts offers do I request a booking. Because of this careful matching I usually do tend to come away with favorable reviews.  However, Lynn's home surpassed all our expectations in every category. 
<BR />
<BR />Rather than the 2-bedroom I'd expected, there were actually 3-bedrooms, so perhaps a prior study has been converted, not sure. But all 3 bedrooms were comfortably decorated. The location was in a great part of town at the end of the drive.  A beautiful, thick wooded area looms beyond the back patio and expansive yard. Having left my TX home in a drought w/threat of wildfires, I was most excited on the evenings I could leave the window raised by my bedside to hear the rain and night sounds.
<BR />
<BR />The house was exceptionally clean and had every house appliance, spice, etc you could ever need. In fact, we found several items recently purchased in fridge and counter top </P></LI>

From Spencer's Butte, Pre's Trail, Mount Pisgah, to Skinner's Butte, it's easy to get around from Peg's by bike, foot, or car.  My place is good for couples, and solo adventurers.<BR /><BR />I've created Peg's Place for my visiting family, friends, and you.  You will find that it is very compact (ala little house - 223 square feet), with everything you need to be comfortable.  <BR />The kitchen is fully equipped with pots, pans, utensils, dishes and basic food staples.  You are welcome to it all. Feel free to let your culinary creativity flow.   If you find you need something more, just let me know and I'll bring it over.  <BR />The bed is the most comfortable sofa sleeper made.  Check out American Leather Comfort Sleeper for details on the foam mattress, and the ease of opening and closing the bed.  You will find that the bed will have the bottom sheet already on it (having it folded up </DIV>

                <LI><P>Amazing stay - if you're in town don't bother with a hotel. Amazing chef-prepared breakfast (beyond expectations), local tips, stories, history, music, cocktails, etc. Rooms were authentic to the period (antique furnishing) but Very clean. <BR /><BR />Price seemed low for everything included - if just a room I'd say it's spot on. Toss in all the extras, I'd say this place might run all the hotels in the area out of business. This place absolutely made our stay in Layfayette!<BR /><BR /></P></LI>

                <LI><P>A nice historic plantation house to stop off on our way to New Orleans! My kids enjoyed the 2 flights of stairs to our room and the creaky sounds. Also, the elf door leading to the bathroom from the hallway and the claw foot tub. The hosts were super friendly, we enjoyed learning about the Cajun's natural mosquito repellant and hearing the accordion in the morning at breakfast.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We had a fantastic one night stay at Plantation Mouton Bois Des Chenes enroute to New Orleans. We stayed in the Carriage House which was clean, comfy and had good WiFi. Ravi greeted us with wine and delicious cookies fresh out of the oven and John cooked us up a stellar breakfast feast the next day (fruit salad, crab omelette, jalapeno sausage and biscuits). Loved having a tour of the house and getting John's run down on the area. Highly recommended (don't forget to get the breakfast)!</P></LI>

From cocktails when you check in to cajun jam sessions to historical tours of the property, John and Ravi made us feel like family immediately.  This is a true bed and breakfast and a STEAL at the price they charge! The room was charming, private, and smelled great!  Don't think twice about staying here because this place is an experience not to be missed when in Lafayette! Cant wait to come back!</P></LI>

The apartment itself is not near a lot, but it was a short Lyft to downtown where there were lots of bars and restaurants to check out. The apartment has everything you need, was comfortable clean and ready for us. I would recommend staying here, especially if you're going to see a concert at Syndicate Lounge like we were! </P></LI>

The stay is the basement of her house. There are no windows in the bedroom part so keep that in mind.

The entire city is within 15 mins by car so a trip to the mall, tourist spots, major business centers or the freeway for a trip out of town is a breeze. <BR /><BR />House is located two blocks from a major bus route. Ubers and taxis are also very easy to call.<BR /><BR />Parking is on street in front of the house. There is a street light at the corner and I usually leave the front porch light on so your car will be fairly lit. As with any street parking I do not recommend you leave valuables in the car. If you are traveling with a lot of stuff I will switch with you and have you park in a locked garage. I can also do that if you are not comfortable with street parking. Just let me know.</DIV>

The room is right across from the master and off by the living room so if you're looking for a quiet room by yourself be aware of this. Had a great time and will definitely recommend in the future! </P></LI>

Their place is a darling wine country home, we had our own room and bathroom right next door. Super clean, detailed. Had everything we needed and more!! Read the house manual and guidelines, they every question answered!! Also like that they are a permitted rental host! They suggested some great restaurants and wineries also, everything was very accessible by uber!! Will definitely stay again next time we are in Napa, hopefully sooner than later! :)</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Randall's place is amazing! I would absolutely stay here again, and hope to next time I'm in Denver. Plenty of delicious snacks provided, and Randall was easily reachable for questions we had during our stay, and even came by with more snacks!<BR /><BR />It really did feel like a separate apartment! The sauna and jacuzzi were fantastic. Great neighborhood, close to restaurants and dispensaries. Extensive guidebook of things to do in the area. <BR /><BR />The backyard space was quiet, fenced in and beautifully landscaped-- probably my favorite thing about the place. <BR /><BR />Thanks for helping to make our stay in Denver awesome!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This one, by far, one of the best listings I've had the pleasure of staying in. Randall was an excellent host and communicated often, even asking if I needed any specific groceries. The studio is exquisite: it's decorated very well and has far more amenities than some 5-star hotels I've stayed in. The infrared sauna was a treat; nothing like sweating out the toxins after traveling all day! And then there's the amazing shower (and yes, there's a deep, jetted tub for those of you who prefer long baths). He offered many toiletries for my use, even Origins masks, which I splurged on and used two. The bed was comfortable and the rugs that are on the floor are nice and soft; bring slippers or socks if you get cold feet, though, as most of the floors are not carpeted. The Nespresso machine was a treat (I could even make my own foam for a cappucino!) and Randall left snacks and drinks in the fridge. If you're looking for a ..</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This was a great place to stay! Located in a cool, walkable neighborhood. My only issue was the wireless internet would not connect with any of my devices. There is an Ethernet cable, but unfortunately none of my devices had a port, so it was not very helpful. I did end up exploring some nearby coffee shops as a result since this was a business trip. So this apartment would be ideal if you are looking to "unplug" for a little bit. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Laura's home is in a safe, friendly, residential neighbourhood close to Bradley University. She keeps her home to a really high standard and is well prepared for guests. The house is lovely and her dog is sweet and friendly, and our room was spacious, comfortable and nicely decorated. Laura was easy to communicate with and helpful, and we enjoyed our stay in her home. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>In one word: HOME. Absolutely would return again. Kind, warm and accommodating. It is a 3 minute walk from where the Peoria Charter drops you off on Bradley University Campus. Super spacious and comfortable bed. Little details count and she did a great job. Snacks and toiletries were provided in very thoughtful way. The key system indicating what is for AIRBNB use is genius. Thank you for the tea... and I can't forget to say thank you for letting Chase (the dog) hangout with me. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>I stayed upstairs which was basically a combined open living area and sleeping area that led out to the balcony. While there was no closed off private space, I was the only one in this area so to me it felt pretty private and I enjoyed the space. As for the rest of the house, there were many other people staying, but most of the time no one was ever in the common areas so it felt like no one was around. I think this is a good affordable place to stay for solo travelers. Sherry has a good heart and took care to ensure a comfortable stay throughout!</P></LI>

My flight was delayed and I got there at 1:30 A.M., she welcomed me with a cheer. I was there on a 2 day weekend business trip and had very little time to see around. She loaned me beach slippers and a beach towel when I went to Waikiki Beach!! Her home is in a beautiful upmarket neighborhood and is very nice. I would definitely recommend staying here.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Loved everything about the rental.  We arrived late at night and everything was set for us to have a stress free check-in.  The rental was clean, well-stocked with coffee, granola bars, bottled water and even croissants.  The rental is very private and the neighborhood is quiet.  We stayed a total of 3 nights and were not around much during the day. In summary, the rental exceeded our expectations, Michele was very responsive and professional throughout all communications. Would highly recommend.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I stayed at Michele's place for 2 nights. The place is exactly like the pictures in the listing. Being a 1-minute walk to the beach was the best. Michele provides extra towels and beach towels; it came in handy for our beach trips every day. Michele is a great host and very responsive. We didn't encounter any problems while staying at her place. Thanks Michele!</P></LI>

Great with kids as well as it's just a couple of steps to the beach. Shops in driving distance have all you need. <BR />Michelle is a great host and always available. Simply awesome! :)</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Michelle's place was excellent. The location is in a local area without the tourist noise. The beach you have access to is perfect for watching the sunrise or a quick swim. Michelle herself is very friendly and clearly takes pride in being an Airbnb host. Lots of little extras are available in the space (water, snacks coal for the BBQ etc), we really enjoyed the banana pancake mix provided :)<BR /><BR />So glad we stayed and got to experience a quiet local neighborhood! Highly recommended!</P></LI>

A beach all to ourselves, made for a relaxing way to spend the day reading under a palm tree!  They also provide beach chairs, towels, and boogie boards.</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">Enjoy South Beach in one of the best locations in my clean, quiet & remodeled studio!<BR /><BR />You're only 2 blocks from the beach and 1 block from fashionable retailers, restaurants, bars, convenience stores, bike rentals & parking structure! <BR /><BR />FREE WiFi!<BR /><BR />My place is close to News Cafe, Wet Willie's, Otentic Fresh Food Restaurant, Cafe Del Mar, and Larios on the Beach. My place is good for couples and solo adventurers.<BR /><BR />My condo is permitted under a condo hotel license available at check in.<BR /><BR />Enjoy the convenience of a great location in a clean and quiet updated studio! The building is no frills, but you can't beat the location for the price. It's located on the calm side of a hotel - which also means you get access to a 24 hours front desk ( say you lost your key at the beach...).<BR /><BR />It's just been tastefully renovated too! While it is 270 sqft, you can comfortably enjoy a luxurious queen size bed ( 3 inch memory foam topper mattress</DIV>

            <DIV class="description">The property is centrally located in Hawaii so its 20 minutes from Waikiki or 30 from North Shore. 11 miles  to Pearl Harbor and Hickam. Being in the middle of the island allows you to be able to not feel confined to just one area. Honestly being here for 17 years has proven that one day or night in Waikiki is all you need in your life. There is so many amazing places to see and go.</DIV>

                <LI><P>We arrived in the evening and were only at the house for one night. Clay was out when we showed up but he had arranged for us to check in . We appreciated the effort   he made so that we would feel welcome,  such as a leaving light on in the entry way as well as in our room. The  bed was comfortable and there were a number of foods available for breakfast.  The listing is a fair distance from the I5 and has limited furniture but is great value for a short stay.  We were quite satisfied.  </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Great location for a weekend getaway to Bisbee!  The unit is spacious and has an awesome wrap-around deck that we enjoyed every night.  The fan in the bedroom didn't work when we were there and the bed is a little small and uncomfortable but I still gave a 5-star review because I assume the fan will be fixed and bed comfort is a subjective issue.  We would come back here for sure!</P></LI>

T & R have extra nice touches to make guest comfortable and welcome. I was there two nights and would come back to stay here on another visit to Bisbee. <BR /><BR />The location is just super. About five minutes or less from all of the city fun when you walk downhill. Five minutes to great visuals, birds, and flowers when you walk up OK Street. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>We had a wonderful time at Cindy's place! Upon arrival, Cindy showed us around the house and was extremely considerate to all our needs. The house was beautiful and very clean. The yard and the views are just lovely, and we spent a lot of time sitting in the yard enjoying the weather. It was super peaceful and quiet the entire time, except for when a big, loud train went by in the evening. We enjoyed checking out the unique rooms and playing the board games, including horseshoes in the backyard.<BR /><BR />Thank you Cindy for a wonderful stay!</P></LI>

We booked the property for a 2 day getaway for a surprise party to a would be groom and bride and this place had all ingredients to make the trip a memorable one. <BR /><BR />Cindy is very accommodating. She was very flexible to give us a late check in and was courteous to allow us 3 hours of extra time for check out. We were greeted by a box of fresh home made cookies, coffee and bananas. <BR />The house is amazing will all facilities. Name it, and its here... outdoor grill, fire pit, wifi, comforters, pillows, fully loaded kitchen etc... we had an amazing stay and will come back here soon. <BR /><BR />Cheers!</P></LI>

The kitchen was perfect for cooking for a big crowd and you can't beat the view at sunset. Perfect escape from busy Phoenix. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Cindy's place is wonderful! It has an incredibly warm and comfy atmosphere and had everything we needed for a weekend away. I brought a large group of college students for a staff retreat and it was the perfect get-a-way for us to rest and relax, and it is really close to the mountains which allows for some fun adventures too. Cindy was an amazing host (and her homemade cookies are really delicious!). I would highly recommend this home!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>Greg and I, our four children, spouses, five grandchildren, and Callie the dog had our 2nd annual family reunion at the Roost in March 2017.  Our host, Cindy, was there to welcome us when we arrived, brought us freshly baked cookies, and offered many good suggestions for sightseeing, exploring, and eating.  The Roost was the perfect size and setting, in addition to being well-supplied with things we needed.  We all loved being together and checking out the immediate area and beyond.  The younger grandkids especially loved watching the trains go by, and the older ones had a great time at the Renaissance Festival, the old mine site, hiking, and a couple of museums in Phoenix.  We highly recommend the Roost and are now enjoying the memories we made there.</P></LI>

Luckily Naomi was super flexible and let us check in early. The house has a welcoming but hip vibe; has everything you need to make it feel like home. Also has some great places to eat just down the street and it is the perfect distance from downtown.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>My husband and I travelled to Portland for the first time and Naomi's house was absolutely wonderful in every way. Located in Beaverton, just a short drive from downtown and the airport, it was a quiet escape nestled on the end of the street in a nice neighborhood. We rented a car, so the drive downtown was super quick and easy but there is public transit as well. The house itself was perfect for us because we like to cook, so the kitchen had everything (and more) that we needed to whip up a meal. There are tons of games and cards to play during a fun night in front of the cozy fireplace. Also, the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept on, even more than our bed back home. It's not often you stay in an airbnb and think, 'gosh, I wish this were my home.' We would highly recommend Naomi's place to anyone looking for a cozy getaway in a beautiful city.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>I was blown away by Jan and Charlie's stellar hosting before I even arrived at their place in Jackson -- they were so communicative and focused on making sure I'd be comfortable. Once I arrived, the experience somehow got even better: the cottage is wonderful, and every detail seems to have been considered and taken care of. I enjoyed sitting on the porch in one of the rocking chairs and reading, talking to Jan, and just taking in the lovely courtyard. This is Southern hospitality at its absolute finest: if you have the chance to stay here, don't pass it up!</P></LI>

We spent our time walking the long white beach (only 1 block from the house) and dining at all the fun places in town (also within walking distance).

                <LI><P>I really enjoyed my stay at Lauren's. It's perfect if you want to be able to easily access the entire island because it's just as far from Ka'ena point as it is to Haleiwa. The shared room was perfect because I was only there to sleep. One thing I loved was how close this Airbnb was to a Buddhist temple. I would definitely stay here again.</P></LI>

            <DIV class="description">Strategically by the tourist-frequented, legendary Calle Ocho; so you are right where the action is. Just 5 minutes from Downtown and 8 minutes to Brickell. You need only drive 10 minutes to Vizcaya museum, 13 to Wynwood walls, and 15 to Key Biscayne and South Beach.<BR />You don't have a car? Not a problem. The Bus Stop is just a 2 minute walk away. Discount stores are everywhere by leg.<BR />Awesome for couples, solo adventurers, friends and business travellers..<BR /><BR />It is a social place. So prepare to laugh and make new friends. But rules are certainly in place to GUARANTEE a good night sleep and overall peaceful environment.<BR /><BR />Guests can access every part of the house. They, however, cannot access the house manager's personal room unless invited, and they cannot sleep on another guest's bed or use another person's personal stuff.<BR />They have access to the fridge, microwave, cooker, kitchen cabinets, wifi, television (if provided), dishwasher, dishes (if available</DIV>

                <LI><P>The house was larger than I expected with two stories and had a beautiful, clean interior. Kim was accommodating, letting me check-in a couple hours earlier to leave my luggage there while I went out to explore downtown. Although I never saw or met Kim, the tenant Sarah was usually always home and was a very nice person whom I had good conversations with. </P></LI>

Super close to downtown and every tourist spot was no more than 10-15 minutes away. I never felt unsafe here. The people are lovely company, as well as the animals. You really get a bang for your buck here!</P></LI>

Never met the host because I came in from my drive so late and had to leave so early. signage around the house made everything easy to understand/find, free WiFi! Room was clean, house was inviting and pleasant, bed was probably the most comfortable thing I've slept on in years. 5/5 if youre traveling through Chicago and need a place to stay the night, would absolutely recommend.</P></LI>

                <LI><P>We rented this place because we were attending a funeral in Birmingham. It was really the closest to Birmingham we could find in our price range and that wouldn't be out of the way for the interment, which was in Montevallo. If we were only going to be in Birmingham, it was a bit far. But if you're travelling to Montevallo for any reason, this place is perfect. It's tucked away up on a wooded hill and there is a lot of space. It was just the two of us and we could have brought the entire family (not that we wanted to do that). The place is furnished well and there are coffee supplies and bottled water in the kitchen. It was cold the two nights we were there and the furnace seems to heat a bit unevenly but there are a couple of space heaters which made up for that quite nicely and my husband and I were warm. We had a little trouble deciding on our sleeping arrangements - the first night we slept separately in the two ground level bedrooms which have full size beds, and the second night </P></LI>

                <LI><P>We enjoyed our stay at Terry and Sarah's place. It was our son's birthday and we arrived to find that our hosts had left us lots of little goodies (cookies, fruit, coffee etc) which was an unexpected delight! The property is wooded and very beautiful to walk around on. It is also very near to a couple of parks which was great for us. Oak Mountain State Park is also a short drive away. We would definitely stay at terry and Sarah's place again!</P></LI>

                <LI><P>This place is delightful. It is exactly as described and so wonderfully secluded. Terry and Sarah were so kind to us, and even left special snacks and toys for our young daughters. I'd recommend their guest house to anyone traveling, and plan to stay again in the future. </P></LI>

                <LI><P>Terry and Sarah's Windmill guest house is a great place to relax in the peaceful setting of Montevallo. There was much to explore and do in the surrounding area, or enjoy the amenities of the home with some Bach on the stereo system.  I would be happy to stay at Terry and Sarah's guest house again. </P></LI>
